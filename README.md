### What is QWeb?
As you probably now, the official Quora app on Android is equivalent to this: üí©

It has been plagued of bugs that are never fixed by the dev team. So, I took the matters in my own hands, by making a Quora app based on the [mobile website](https://www.quora.com?prevent_redirect=1). I also wanted to add some tweaks, including one removing ads and monetized answers and posts, another one restoring the old profile layout, and even a PIN/biometric lock.

Don't worry, you can disable any of these features.

It will be THE app to Make Quora Great Again!

*If you see "For your security, your phone currently isn't allowed to install unknown apps from this source.", click on "Settings", then "Allow from this source/Allow unknown sources".*
### Frequently asked questions
**When there will be an iOS version?**

No.

**Will the app allow me to view Quora+ locked content?**

No. The app only hides it. Also, I wouldn't recommend you to subscribe to this scam.

**Where is the language switch button?**

Right now, the app is made to work on Quora English. Other languages seem to break the app. I plan to add support for them later.

**But I wanted my other languages! üò≠**

Use the [mobile website](https://www.quora.com?prevent_redirect=1).

**I forgot my PIN code for the app!**

Clear the app data. *App info -> Storage -> Clear data*.

**What is the "old profile layout"?**

**Facebook/Google login does not work!**

Normal bug. I'm still trying to solve it.
